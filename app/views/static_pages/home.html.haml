        For example, is climate change real? If NASA, the Royal Society, Obama, the Pope and a friend of mine who knows more about this than I agree, I believe it.
      .col-md-4
        Nowadays most people agree that climate change is real, but not so long ago it was quite different and having a database of who agrees and disagrees might have sped up the collective discussion and decision making.
      .col-md-4
        There was a time when on TV they mostly interviewed one person who agreed and one who disagreed on climate change, just to be neutral even though most scientists were in agreement.
