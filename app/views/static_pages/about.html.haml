  %h2.text-center About AgreeList
  %p AgreeList project traces back to a random encounter of the two founders Hector and Emilie... thanks to Airbnb! Hector was renting a room in Emilie's flatshare in London, and they quickly discovered that they were both passionated by the empowerment technology endows to individuals in changing the world.

  %p Idealist enough to believe they could have a meaningful impact, they also realized that they had very complementary skills to embark together in a new venture. Hector, a software engineer by profession, had already founded a startup and was involved in participatory democracy initiatives. Emilie, a former investment banker, had recently reconnected with her political sciences academic background with a second graduate degree in social sciences.
  %p
    After endless debates on how to improve the quality of public debate as well as the accountability of opinion leaders, the AgreeList project was born with an ambitious
    %b mission: fight the polarization of opinions and promote constructive debates by organizing people's opinions and ideas.
  %p
    AgreeList wants to improve decision making by developing a tool which:
    %ul
      %li Gathers and organizes trackable opinions by storing them in a unique database
      %li Favors plurality of opinions, including those little supported by traditional medias
      %li Shows in real time what people think and why, on both sides of controversial topics.
